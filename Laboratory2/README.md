In this laboratory work I integrated the template from Laboratory work 1 with asp.net framework to create an asp.net mvc web application.

This application supports 3 distinct pages as in previous lab. The landing page, contacts and about.

The project can be found in the following repository : https://github.com/DEMENCI/MoviesPlatform

In the repository I included the whole folder of the project. To run it in Visual Studio you need the folder MoviesPlatform.
