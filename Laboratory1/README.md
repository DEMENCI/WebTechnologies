In this laboratory work we should create a simple web page styled with bootstrap.

My page is suposed to be the landing page of the web application Movies Platform which is ment to be used for wantchig movies.

The project can be found in the following repository: https://github.com/DEMENCI/WebTechnologies

For this lab work I am using bootstrap provided by maxcdn. For the navigation bar i used the coresponding clases from bootstrap.

From the landing page the user should choose an option and then through other pages make a request.
